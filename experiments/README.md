# Experiments

This directory contains scripts to run adversarial OCR experiments.

`diacritical-experiment.py` runs an experiment specified by CLI arguments.

`process-pickles.py` combines the results of multiple experiments as consolidated Python pickle and JSON files.

## Installation Notes

For the visrep experiments to work, fairseq needs to be installed using the [visrep fork](https://github.com/esalesky/visrep). The install script will do this for you.
